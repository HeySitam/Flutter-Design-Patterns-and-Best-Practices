**Build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready apps using effective architectural principles**

## What is this book about?
As Flutter continues its rapid adoption by developers and businesses alike, the demand for skilled developers who can deliver high-quality Flutter apps continues to increase as well. Moreover, when you're building for yourself, you don’t always need to think about scalability and business goals, if you’re simply developing apps as a hobby. However, when you build apps for businesses, you're helping them use specific tools to achieve their goals, which requires solutions to be fast, reliable, and delivered on time. This book will help you meet these business requirements.
	
This book covers the following exciting features:
* Translate business requirements into technical solutions
* Understand when and where specific design patterns would be applicable
* Separate concerns into multiple layers with scoped responsibility
* Build reusable architecture that can be applied to any type of app and supported by various teams
* Debug and solve problems before they reach the user
* Avoid production bugs by prioritizing testing during the development cycle
* Design encapsulated features that are resilient to business requirement changes and software updates
